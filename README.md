## Introduction

In recent years, there have been great advancements in the field of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, where automation of lengthy, tedious, and manually implemented algorithms have been replaced with powerful and dynamic language libraries, that have logic programmed already with easy language syntax, thereby making implementations faster. Data Mining techniques have also seen notable improvements lately that enable people to get deeper understanding of various kinds of datasets, and hence infer better targeted prediction, bringing out several unknown or unobserved interpretations of the data.

Complex datasets that have considerably huge size and mediocre usability ratings might indicate towards a possible tendency of mediocrity in the prediction accuracies for the model created based on these datasets. However, it need not be a hard and fast rule and such generalised notions can be claimed incorrect with the use of latest advanced computing tools. The project deals with a dataset of a similar description and finds a variety of methods to create suitable prediction models using Classification Mining Techniques and Deep Learing concepts to yield a higher prediction accuracy than the base paper without overfitting the model for higher accuracy.

## Project Objective

In 1999, Jock A. Blackard and Denis J. Dean implemented Artificial Neural Network and Discriminant Analysis to predict the forest cover from various areas of the Roosevelt National Forest in Colorado, USA.

However, we know from his paper that there is only 71.1% prediction accuracy in the model created by them using Artificial Neural Networks on various columns of data. Even though this method was better than previously implemented traditional Discriminant Analysis, our objective in this project is to find solutions to better the accuracy using the exact same dataset by creating various classification models.

This dataset includes information on tree type, shadow coverage, wilderness of the surrounding, distance to nearby landmarks (roads etc), soil type, local topography, etc. The dataset is very large having more than 0.5 million item sets. Its usability is 5.9 according to premiere data science websites.

The above dataset has been taken from the University of California Irvine Machine Learning Repository, and the source can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Covertype), and the dataset is also present in the main branch of the repository as [covtype.csv](https://github.com/arjundas1/Forest-Cover-Prediction-using-Classification-Mining-Techniques-and-Deep-Learning/blob/main/covtype.csv). Finally the accuracy and overall prediction performance of the model is gauged for efficient use.

## Tools Used

To achieve the project objective we make use of the following tools -
* **Classification Mining Techniques**
  * Logistic Regression
  * Gaussian Naive Bayes'
  * K-Nearest Neighbors
  * Support-Vector Machine
  * Random Forest Classification

* **Python Language Libraries**
  * Seaborn
  * Matplotlib
  * Scikit-learn
  * Pandas
  * Keras
  * Tensorflow
 
* **R Language Libraries** 
  * Tidyverse
  * Skimr

## Methodology

1. Understanding the components of the dataset.
2. Creating visuals that will aid us with the understanding and enable us to find the proper combination of data columns for high accuracy.
3. Using various classification mining algorithms to create models that yield certain prediction accuracy for certain combination of data columns.
4. Fitting models appropriately and checking if any model has been overfitted or underfitted.
5. Iterating certain column combinations and algorithms for a large number of times to find the best train-test split and record that prediction percentage as well as the split content in a separate binary file for future use.
6. Using Deep Learning technique on the dataset and yield prediction accuracy.
7. Comaparing the performance of all the algorithms and concluding with the most recommended algorithm with this dataset.
