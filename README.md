## Project Objective

> In 1999, Blackard used Artificial neural network and discriminant analysis to predict the
forest cover from various areas of the Roosevelt National Forest in Colorado, USA.
However, we know from his [paper](https://www.fs.fed.us/rm/ogden/research/publications/downloads/journals/1999_compag_blackard.pdf) that there is only 71.1% prediction
accuracy. Our objective of this project is to better the accuracy using the exact same
dataset by creating various classification models.
>
>> This dataset includes information on tree type, shadow coverage, distance to nearby
landmarks (roads etcetera), soil type, and local topography. The dataset is very large
having more than 581K item sets.
>>
>>> The above dataset is a part of the University of California (Irvine) Machine Learning
Repository, and the source can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Covertype). Finally the accuracy and overall prediction performance of the model is gauged for
efficient use.

## Tools Used

To achieve the project objective we make use of the following tools -
* **Classification Mining Techniques**
  * Logistic Regression
  * K-Nearest Neighbors
  * Support-Vector Machine
  * Random Forest Classification
* **Deep Learning**
  * Deep Learning API Keras
* **Python Language**
  * Machine Learning Library Scikit-learn
  * Data Analysis Library Pandas
* **R Language** 
  * Data Visualization
