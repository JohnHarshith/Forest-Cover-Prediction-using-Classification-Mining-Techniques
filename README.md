## Project Objective

In 1999, Jock A. Blackard and Denis J. Dean implemented Artificial Neural Network and Discriminant Analysis to predict the forest cover from various areas of the Roosevelt National Forest in Colorado, USA.

However, we know from his [paper](https://www.fs.fed.us/rm/ogden/research/publications/downloads/journals/1999_compag_blackard.pdf) that there is only 71.1% prediction
accuracy in the model created by them. Our objective in this project is to find solutions to better the accuracy using the exact same dataset by creating various classification algorithms.

This dataset includes information on tree type, shadow coverage, distance to nearby landmarks (roads etc), soil type, and local topography. The dataset is very large
having more than 581K item sets. Its usability is 5.9.

The above dataset is a part of the University of California Irvine Machine Learning Repository, and the source can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Covertype), and also in the main branch of the repository as [covtype.csv](https://github.com/arjundas1/Forest-Cover-Prediction-using-Classification-Mining-Techniques-and-Deep-Learning/blob/main/covtype.csv). Finally the accuracy and overall prediction performance of the model is gauged for efficient use.
